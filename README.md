   ## Description
   * This web app will be e-commerce mock app that will allow users to select, buy, review, filter, items from a fictional store.
   * The idea so far is to use the paypal sandbox api to mimick a checkout and buy scenerio.
   * This app will use REST apis to call actions from the back end to the front-end
   * At the moment, the application will use React for the front-end. And Flask for the back-end

   ## Github-Practices
   * Please refrain from committing, pushing, making any type of changes from the main branch. Github asks for payments when setting up branch protection so this project will not have it. If this happens, the main branch will have changes and if the changes are buggy, then it could cause alot of bugs to the app. If you would like to make a change, make a different branch and push it up, then make a pull request.
   * Also, Please do not merge your own pull request. Let someone else review and merge your code.
   * If you would like to push up code.. make sure as well you " git add . and git commit -m from the main repo"

   ## Dependencies
   * React.js, Flask
   * future dependencies will be posted here with better format.

   ## Installation
   * if you would like to make changes or have the project for your own practice, simply copy the url or ssh from the top and " git clone " to your desktop or repo
   * make sure you  " npm install " all dependancies for the project
